Austronesian languages are spoken by about 386 million people, making it the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers, behind only the Indo-European languages, the Sino-Tibetan languages, the Niger-Congo languages, and the Afroasiatic languages. It is on par with Indo-European, Niger\u2013Congo, and Afroasiatic as one of the best-established language families. Major Austronesian languages with the highest number of speakers are Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Javanese, and Filipino (Tagalog). The family contains 1,257 languages, which is the second most of any language family.\nOtto Dempwolff was the first researcher to extensively explore Austronesian using the comparative method. Another German, Wilhelm Schmidt, coined the German word austronesisch which comes from Latin auster \"south wind\" plus Greek n\u00easos \"island\". The name Austronesian was formed from the same roots. The family is aptly named, as the vast majority of Austronesian languages are spoken on islands: only a few languages, such as Malay and the Chamic languages, are indigenous to mainland Asia. Many Austronesian languages have very few speakers, but the major Austronesian languages are spoken by tens of millions of people and one Austronesian language, Malay (incl. Indonesian and Malaysian), is spoken by 250 million people, making it the 8th most spoken language in the world. Twenty or so Austronesian languages are official in their respective countries (see the list of major and official Austronesian languages).\nDifferent sources count languages differently, but Austronesian and Niger\u2013Congo are the two largest language families in the world, each having roughly one-fifth of the total languages counted in the world. The geographical span of Austronesian was the largest of any language family before the spread of Indo-European in the colonial period, ranging from Madagascar off the southeastern coast of Africa to Easter Island in the eastern Pacific. Hawaiian, Rapa Nui, and Malagasy (spoken on Madagascar) are the geographic outliers of the Austronesian family.\nAccording to Robert Blust (1999), Austronesian is divided in several primary branches, all but one of which are found exclusively on Taiwan. The Formosan languages of Taiwan are grouped into as many as nine first-order subgroups of Austronesian. All Austronesian languages spoken outside Taiwan (including its offshore Yami language) belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch, sometimes called Extra-Formosan.\nMost Austronesian languages lack a long history of written attestation, making the feat of reconstructing earlier stages \u2013 up to distant Proto-Austronesian \u2013 all the more remarkable. The oldest inscription in the Cham language, the \u0110\u00f4ng Y\u00ean Ch\u00e2u inscription, dated to the mid-6th century at the latest, is also the first attestation of any Austronesian language." }, { "id": "Li'o language", "node": 3, "group": 301, "sum": "Li'o, K\u00e9o, or Ende-Li'o, is a Malayo-Polynesian dialect cluster spoken on Flores in Indonesia." }, { "id": "Central Philippine languages", "node": 4, "group": 118, "sum": "The Central Philippine languages are the most geographically widespread demonstrated group of languages in the Philippines, being spoken in southern Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao, and Sulu.

There was no crown present at the ceremony.\nWhen, in 1815, Willem was proclaimed \"King of the Netherlands\" in Brussels, he was not crowned but there was a crown present, a huge and unusable construction of gilded copper, pearls made of pasted fishskin and coloured glass. The four holes in the ring, the peculiar size and the lack of a bill in the accounts that do contain the jeweler's bill for the gilded silver orb and sceptre, suggest that it was the old \"funeral crown\", used by the Stadtholders in the 18th century and then tied to a cushion on top of the coffin when driven to the vault in Delft. This crown still exists. It may have been used for royal funerals in the 19th century.\nThe Dutch College of Arms (the \"Hoge Raad van Adel\") approved of a new royal coat of arms with crown on 24 August 1815. From then on, the heraldic crown and the actual crown would differ.\nThe heraldic crown was described as \"a bejeweled golden ring with golden fleurons and pearls, eight rising arches studded with pearls and topped with an orb with a cross. The crown is not lined with velvet.\"\nIn 1840, King Willem I abdicated and a new crown was made. This small crown contains no real diamonds or pearls. It was made of gilded silver, balls covered with fish skin and glass with coloured foil behind it. The lining was made of red silk. Willem II and his successors chose not to wear it, but to leave it on a special table during the ceremony when both the King and the States-General take the oath. The crown was used in royal funerals.\nIn 1898, 24 of the 74 pearls were removed as the crown was prepared for the installation of Queen Wilhelmina. The crown has not changed since then. It was the monarch's private property until 1963. It was given to a foundation controlled by the Royal Family and has never been on display, except for the investitures of 1898, 1948, 1980, 2013, a funeral in 1934 and an exhibition in 1990." }, { "id": "Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother", "node": 15, "group": 49, "sum": "The Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, also known as The Queen Mother's Crown, is the crown made for Queen Elizabeth, the wife of King George VI, to wear at their coronation in 1937 and State Openings of Parliament during her husband's reign.

The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).\nThe City of London is widely referred to simply as the City (differentiated from the phrase \"the city of London\" by capitalising City) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile, as it is 1.12 sq mi (2.90 km2) in area. Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom's trading and financial services industries, which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City. The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City. London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis, or the 32 London boroughs, in addition to the City of London itself. This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888, when the County of London was created.\nThe local authority for the City, namely the City of London Corporation, is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council, such as being the police authority. It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries. The Corporation is headed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London, an office separate from (and much older than) the Mayor of London.

The metacentric height (GM), which dominates stability, can be estimated from the design, but an accurate value must be determined by an inclining test.\nThe inclining test is usually done inshore in calm weather, in still water, and free of mooring restraints to achieve accuracy. The GM position is determined by moving weights transversely to produce a known overturning moment in the range of 1-4 degrees if possible. Knowing the restoring properties (buoyancy) of the vessel from its dimensions and floating position and measuring the equilibrium angle of the weighted vessel, the GM can be calculated.\nInclinings can be performed in service by averaging out the effects of motions caused by waves.

Temperature affects the level, because warm water provides less buoyancy, being less dense than cold water, as does salinity, because fresh water is less dense than seawater. For vessels with displacement hulls, the hull speed is determined by, among other things, the waterline length. In a sailing boat, the waterline length can change significantly as the boat heels, and can dynamically affect the speed of the boat.\nThe waterline can also refer to any line on a ship's hull that is parallel to the water's surface when the ship is afloat in a normal position.

Production rose greatly with national prohibition in 1919, and Bevo was by far the most popular of the many \"cereal beverages\" or \"near beers\" of the time. At the peak of its popularity in the early 1920s, more than five million cases of Bevo were sold annually.\n\nLabels on the bottles billed it as \"Bevo the Beverage\". The name \"Bevo\" was coined from the word \"beverage\" and the Slavic language word for beer \"pivo\", and was pronounced \"Bee-vo\".\nSome Bevo advertising featured the character \"Renard the Fox\" (based on the protagonist of a medieval French folk-tale), and promotional mugs with this character were manufactured. In 1930 Anheuser-Busch built a series of boat-bodied cars in its St. Louis shops called the \"Bevo Boats\" which were used for promotion. Seven are believed to have been built on Pierce-Arrow 8-cylinder chassis while one surviving example was based upon 1930 Cadillac 353 V8.\n\nA contemporary advertisement read \"Cooling and invigorating, Bevo the Beverage.

Milk or water may contain bacteria. BEVO never does.\"\nBevo became part of the popular culture of the time, and is mentioned in various popular songs and Vaudeville skits of the era. This led to secondary slang uses of the word; for example, in American military slang a young and inexperienced officer was called a \"Bevo\". The University of Texas named its mascot \"Bevo\", a name which has stuck to this day.\nIrving Berlin included a paean to the drink, \"You Can't Stay Up on Bevo\", in his 1917 army revue, Yip Yip Yaphank. In addition, in his song The Near Future, which includes the ubiquitous lyric \"How Dry I Am\", Bevo is featured prominently.

The Kennedy later merges with the southern end of the Edens Expressway (Interstate 94) at Montrose Avenue; the Kennedy (at this point both I-90 and I-94) then turns south to its junction with the Dan Ryan and Eisenhower Expressways and Congress Parkway at the Jane Byrne Interchange in downtown Chicago.\nWith up to 327,000 vehicles traveling on some portions of the Kennedy daily, the Kennedy and its South Side extension, the Dan Ryan, are the busiest roads in Illinois." }, { "id": "Trade Expansion Act", "node": 68, "group": 197, "sum": "Under the Trade Expansion Acts of 1965 (Pub.L. 87\u2013794, 76 Stat. 872, enacted October 11, 1962, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801), the United States Congress granted the White House unprecedented authority to negotiate tariff reductions of up to 80%.

She is the eighth of nine children born to Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald, and is their longest-lived and last surviving child. Her siblings include President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, longtime Senator Ted Kennedy, and Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver.\nSmith is the founder of Very Special Arts (VSA), an internationally recognized non-profit dedicated to creating a society where those with disabilities can engage with the arts. In 2011, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Barack Obama for her work with VSA and the disabled.\nAs Ambassador to Ireland, Smith was instrumental to the Northern Ireland peace process as President Bill Clinton's representative in Dublin. She was heavily criticised after advocating for the U.S. government to grant a visa to Sinn F\u00e9in President Gerry Adams, although her family would claim this influenced the IRA declaring a ceasefire in 1994.

The resolution demanded North Korea immediately end its invasion of South Korea, the catalyst for the beginning of the Korean War. The measure was adopted by a vote of 9 support, none opposed, and one abstention.\nThe Korean Peninsula had been divided between occupation forces of the United States and the Soviet Union since the end of World War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between the two Koreas. These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government.\nThe resolution called on the North to immediately halt its invasion and to move its troops back to the 38th parallel. Seen as a diplomatic victory for the United States, the resolution was completely ignored by North Korea. This brought the UN and the US to take further action, setting the state for massive international involvement and the expansion of the Korean War." }], "links": [{ "source": "Voiceless dental and
